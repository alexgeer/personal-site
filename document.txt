A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought. 
The word originates from the Latin documentum, which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson":
 the verb doce≈ç denotes "to teach". In the past, the word was usually used to denote a 
 written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the computer age, "document" 
 usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, 
 e.g. fonts, colors, and images. Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its transmission 
 medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents.
